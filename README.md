The project's core objective was to predict loan approval outcomes by developing a predictive model to classify loan applications as approved or not approved. This project facilitated extensive engagement with loan application data, providing insights into various machine learning techniques. Our approach encompassed diverse methods, including Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, Logistic regression allowing us to identify patterns and draw conclusions based on achieved results.
